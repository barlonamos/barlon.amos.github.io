        miss @EstherKruger and @barlons, you have been an inspiration to all, relationships have lately been depicted as institutions of fight and chaos
        but you have totally disregarded that sentiment in the public domain by presenting unconditional love and pure understanding in your marriage institution.
        Unlike in other relationships where divisive conversations are the course of marriage and relationships catastrophes and agonies, you have kept mutual understanding 
        and a good way of solving issues,which has really helped in the corporate world.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-sub">
        You are a real inspiration to us.Congratulations BC

        It huts to love someone and not be loved in return .But what is most painful is to love someone and not find the
      courage to let them know how you feel for them.
      <!-- Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right ones,so that when we finally meet the right
      person we will know how to be greatfull for that gift. -->
      Love is when you take away the passion , the feeling and the remembrance of the relationship , and find out that
      you still care for that person
      A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means alot to you only to find out in the end it was not meant to
      be , and you just have to let go.
      <!-- When the door of happiness closses , another opens but often times we look so much at the closed door that we dont
      see the one that has been opened for us.The best kind of
      friend is the one you can be with, never say a word and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation
      you ever had.
      It is true that but it is also true that we dont know what we've been missing untill it arrives -->
